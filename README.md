## Config

The configuration can be found in `config.yml`.

#### keybinds

in the keybinds section you can configure the keybinds
some examples for the syntax are:
- `<shift> + <alt> + g`
- `<space> + <ctrl>`
- `h`

#### counter

Here you can configure the counter behaviour.
The `hold-delay` is how quickly the coutner counts up while holding, assuming a `hold-multiplier` of 1.
The counter will ramp up to `hold-multiplier` times the base speed.
You can set `hold-multiplier` to 0 to disable the hold feature completely.

#### font

Filename of a font file (either ttf or ttc) in the current directory.

| fps      | 60      | The framerate of the final video. Lower framerates may make the counter look considerably worse.   |

## Usage

[Notes on Limitations (important for MacOs)](https://pynput.readthedocs.io/en/latest/limitations.html)

When starting, you will be presented with a blank window.

Here you can press `Start` to start counting up, or `Generate Video` to load a recorded count from a file.

Now you can count up by pressing or holding your keybind. Once you're done, you can hit `Save` to save the current coutner to a file, in case you want to generate a video with a different config later. Otherwise, just press `Generate Video`.
![](https://i.vgy.me/86d3lD.png)
Here you can enter a file name to load, or just click `Generate` to use the current counter. Loading from a clip name will discard the current data.

After you click generate, a file named `text0.avi` should have appeared in the current folder. If you pressed `Start/Stop` multiple times there may be multiple other files with the name `text1.avi`, `text2.avi` etc.

Attention: these files will be overwritten if you generate another video. Make sure to rename them or copy them elsewhere.
